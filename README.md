## Project Title: TripAdvisor Restaurant Review Analysis for Naples

# Introduction:

The "TripAdvisor Restaurant Review Analysis for Naples" project is a Python-based endeavor aimed at collecting and analyzing restaurant reviews from TripAdvisor for the top 5 restaurants in Naples, Italy. This comprehensive project involves data scraping, natural language processing, and database management to gain valuable insights into the dining experiences in this picturesque Italian city.

# Project Objectives:

- Data Collection: The first objective of the project is to scrape a substantial number of reviews for the top 5 restaurants in Naples from TripAdvisor. This data will serve as the foundation for subsequent analysis.

- Data Preprocessing: Once the reviews are gathered, we'll preprocess the text by removing stopwords and cleaning the text for analysis.

- Tag Cloud Generation: We will generate word clouds to visualize the 50 most frequently used words in reviews for restaurants with ratings of 4 and 5, as well as for restaurants with ratings of 1, 2, and 3. This will help identify popular and problematic aspects of these establishments.

- Database Creation: To maintain organized and structured data, we will create a database with two tables: "restaurants" and "reviews." The "restaurants" table will store restaurant information, while the "reviews" table will store individual review details.

# Technologies Used:

Python for web scraping, data preprocessing, and analysis.
Libraries like BeautifulSoup, NLTK or spaCy for text processing.
SQLite or other relational databases for database management.
Data visualization libraries such as WordCloud for creating tag clouds.

# Note: It's crucial to abide by TripAdvisor's terms of service and respect data usage policies during the data collection process.

This project will provide valuable insights into the dining experiences in Naples, helping both locals and tourists make informed choices when it comes to dining out in this beautiful Italian city.
